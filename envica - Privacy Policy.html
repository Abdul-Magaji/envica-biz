        <h3>Our Security Measures</h3>
        <p>Our multi-layered approach encompasses network security, data encryption, access control, and organizational policies designed to meet industry standards and best practices. Under this scope, the various methods we use to safeguard your Data include:</p>
        
        <h4>Network Security</h4>
        <p>We leverage Cloudflare's enterprise-grade protection services for both Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) mitigation and Web Application Firewall (WAF) capabilities. This robust solution filters malicious traffic, prevents unauthorized access attempts, and helps maintain service availability even during attack scenarios.</p>
        
        <h4>Data Encryption</h4>
        <p>We implement industry-standard encryption protocols to protect information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data at Rest:</strong> All stored information is secured using AES-256 encryption, ensuring that sensitive data remains protected within our systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Data in Transit:</strong> We employ TLS 1.2 protocols to encrypt all data transmissions between your devices and our servers, preventing interception during network transfer.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Comprehensive Monitoring</h4>
        <p>Our Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution provides real-time monitoring and analysis of system activities. All security logs are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Continuously monitored for suspicious patterns</li>
            <li>Securely stored according to our data retention policies</li>
            <li>Protected against unauthorized access and tampering</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Access Control Management</h4>
        <p>We enforce strict access control measures throughout our systems:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Implemented for both internal staff and external users where applicable, adding an essential layer of security beyond passwords.</li>
            <li><strong>Role-Based Access Control:</strong> A formal protocol governs the assignment, periodic review, and timely revocation of access rights, ensuring the principle of least privilege is maintained.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Organizational Security Measures</h4>
        <p>We foster a security-conscious culture through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Regular Training:</strong> Security awareness education is conducted annually at minimum, covering critical topics such as data handling procedures, threat identification, and secure remote work practices.</li>
            <li><strong>Device and Remote Work Policies:</strong> Comprehensive guidelines govern the secure use of personal devices and establish protocols for remote work environments.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Physical Infrastructure Security</h4>
        <p>Our server infrastructure on AWS data centers reside in facilities equipped with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>24/7 video surveillance systems</li>
            <li>Advanced alarm and intrusion detection systems</li>
            <li>Strict access controls permitting entry only to authorized personnel</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Payment Processing Security</h4>
        <p>We prioritize the security of financial transactions by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Integrating exclusively with PCI-certified payment gateways</li>
            <li>Ensuring no credit card information is stored on our servers</li>
            <li>Maintaining secure transmission channels that bypass our infrastructure for payment data</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Business Continuity Planning</h4>
        <p>To ensure operational resilience, we:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Perform daily data backups</li>
            <li>Maintain secure backup repositories in separate locations</li>
            <li>Follow established recovery procedures to minimize service disruption in the event of an incident</li>
